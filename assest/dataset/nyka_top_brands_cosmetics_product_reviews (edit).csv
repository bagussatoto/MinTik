"42114,""NYX Professional Makeup"",""527662"",""superb!!!"",""I had never done contouring before. So after seeing the reviews and youtube videos i happened to buy nyx wonder stick. I bought shade medium/tan as universal had shimmer in the highlighting part. The shade of contouring and highlighting part are just so perfect for my skin (Indian fair skin). Also being a beginner it was so very easy to work with the product. And the best part which i love is i get a mild contouring look (which generally looks a natural makeup) and it doesnt look artificial at all. So go with it if you want mild contours. Highlight shade is the best. Also it blends so so easily. For me it doesnt take even a min to blend it properly. It has a creamy formula so theres no need of blending fast are worrying about the product which gets settled and does not blend further. Overall very good product for beginners and for ones who want a mild contour look. Worth buying !!!"",""Rushica Javia"",""2017-02-16 14:17:35"",""5.0"",""False"",""False"","""",""NYX Professional Makeup Wonder Stick"",""835"",""835"",""3.8"",""1131"","""",""https://www.nykaa.com/nyx-professional-makeup-wonder-stick/p/42114""";;;;;;;;;;;;

"41880,""NYX Professional Makeup"",""332570"",""Mauve Vintage!"",""OMG! This is an absolutely wonderful liquid lipstick by nyx. I bought this one is the shade 'Vintage'/'Retro'. This is a Mauve kind of shade with a brown muddy undertone which completely justifies the shade's name. The staying power is not that great when compared to Miss Claire's liquid lipstick trust me! But the texture of this one is lighter then the Miss Claire's one. Even the staying power is not that great or something and you may have to reapply it after a meal or after a few hours. One stroke application is enough and also the color can be built up by two or three strokes. The shade is very opaque. Now about me, I have a skin tone one shade darker than Bipasha Basu's current skin tone, a dusky one basically but its not dull. And the shade goes good on me. It looks mauve-ish (lol) but I guess it will ROCK on any Indian skin tone. So it's a safe safe shade. Some might feel its too pricey as the staying power n the quantity we get is not worth 850 bucks I swear. But the shades are wonderful and NYX and Nykaa are trustable ";") can give it a try. I'm also looking forward to try Cherry Skies and Stone Fox(idk abt the latter, not pretty sure. I love this one.

I own SOFTSPOKEN and SAND STROM. Soft spoken is a MLBB shade first when we apply it appears lighter and then gets darker after drying, I use a lipliner to enhance it.

If you are looking for 'your lips but better' kind of shade, I would recommend this for all you dusky skinned beauties. Fair skinned ladies, this colour will appear a bit more pink (brighter) on you guys, nevertheless it'll still be lovely. An everyday shade, perfect for college and office as well.Just dab a little bit of this beauty onto your lips, and a couple of strokes of khol to lighten up your eyes and you are good to go! P.S- Please do moisturize your lips before applying the product,and you can apply two coats to get complete coverage. Once completely dry it's better NOT to add more layers,this might give a cakey effect.

The texture is to die for, it's lightweight, soft and super smooth, doesn't dry out your lips at all. It does transfer a bit but that's alright it did not bother me much. The formula stayed for almost 10-12 hours without budging even after eating, drinking and taking a nap so it's a win-win for me because if a product sustains this, I'm bound to fall in love with it.

"41880,""NYX Professional Makeup"",""593067"",""nice"",""I have these lipsticks in two shades: 1) Sandstorm (07) and Soft-Spoken (04). While reading the reviews I could understand most of the positive and negative comments. I have thin lips that tend to be dry, though not rough nor with lines. I also tend to prefer satin to matte finishes. I have tried them with and without lip primer - they last much longer with lip primer. (You have to let the primer completely set before applying the lip cream. I also apply a very light touch of mineral-based powder on my lips before applying the lip cream). The color also lasts much longer if you use a lipstick sealer because they will transfer easily. (Also allow the lip cream time to dry completely, which won't take long if you use one coat before applying the sealer). However, they do eventually set for me, though admittingly, it takes a while if you use more than one coat. They can become a bit too matte for most peoples' taste. The tacky texture is from multiple layers being applied. These wear best with only one, slow application. I love them because the colors are pretty good for the price, the pigment is decent, and the matte finish. Pros: Formula feels great, slides on lips easily, wand is perfect for shaping, and I love the size of the tube (big) and the larger sized wand (as well as more product), and it's decently pigmented for the price. Cons: Does require some patience to work with, can dry very matte."",""Rinsee Reenu"",""2017-04-14 13:14:03"",""3.0"",""False"",""False"","""",""NYX Professional Makeup Liquid Suede Cream Lipstick"",""850"",""850"",""4.0"",""1191"","""",""https://www.nykaa.com/nyx-professional-makeup-liquid-suede-cream-lipstick/p/41880""";;;;;;;;;;;;

"361744,""NYX Professional Makeup"",""29154443"",""NYX Professional"",""Pros: This is one of my all-time favorite nude shades for my skin tone (NC37). In my opinion the shade is very different from the one shown online - it's actually a lighter brown with mauve/purple thrown in. It gives a smooth matte finish without exacerbating dry lips. The application is very beginner-friendly. Also makes my lips look slightly plumper. Cons: The applicator is not cut-out for a precise finish (but this can be easily rectified by using a lip liner). Also with dry lips it can bring out fine lines on re-application. But the biggest con is its depressingly low staying power. It will transfer with even the smallest sip of water or a light brush against your mask.
